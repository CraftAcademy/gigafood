Feature: List dishes on landing page
  As a end user
  In order to make a selection of dishes
  I would like to view dishes on a webpage

  Background:
    Given the following categories exist:
      | name    | description                | sort_key |
      | Main    | Description for category 2 | 2        |
      | Starter | Description for category 1 | 1        |

    And the following dishes exist:
      | name        | description            | price | min_quantity | category | sort_key |
      | Start first | Description for Dish 1 | 100   | 10           | Starter  | 1        |
      | Corn        | Description for Dish 2 | 200   | 10           | Main     | 2        |
      | Tomato      | Description for Dish 3 | 300   | 20           | Main     | 1        |

  Scenario Outline: View a list of dishes on the screen
    When I go to the landing page
    Then I should see "MAIN"
    Then I should see "STARTER"
    Then I should see "Minimum order: 20"
    Then I should see "<name>"
    Then I should see "<description>"
    Then I should see "<price>"

    Examples:
      | name        | description            | price |
      | Start first | Description for Dish 1 | 100   |
      | Corn        | Description for Dish 2 | 200   |
      | Tomato      | Description for Dish 3 | 300   |

    Scenario:
      When I go to the landing page
      Then Starter should be displayed before Main
      And Tomato should be displayed before Corn last
