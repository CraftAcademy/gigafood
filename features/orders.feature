Feature: List orders
  As Giga-Food
  In order to make a decision to start an order
  I like to have three options approve, cancel and a input filed with transport size

  Background:
    Given an admin exists with email "admin@example.com" and password "password"
    And I'm logged in as admin
    And I go to the dashboard
    And the following categories exist:
      | name     | description                  | sort_key |
      | Starters | Description for starters     | 1        |
      | Mains    | Description for dessertss... | 2        |
      | Desserts | Description for dessertss... | 3        |

    And the following dishes exist:
      | name                 | description | price | min_quantity | category |
      | Starter dish         | description | 100   | 10           | Starters |
      | Another Starter dish | description | 100   | 10           | Starters |
      | Dessert dish         | description | 200   | 10           | Desserts |
      | Main dish            | description | 200   | 10           | Mains    |
      | Another Main dish    | description | 200   | 10           | Mains    |

    And the following orders exist:
      | billing_name | delivery_date    | billing_email          |
      | Bob Schmob   | 2017-11-20 12:00 | bob.schmob@example.com |
      | John Smith   | 2017-10-10 12:00 | john.smith@example.com |
      | Kari Lee     | 2017-10-08 12:00 | kari.lee@example.com   |

    And "Bob Schmob"'s order contains:
      | dish_name            | quantity |
      | Starter dish         | 10       |
      | Another Starter dish | 10       |
      | Dessert dish         | 20       |
      | Main dish            | 20       |
      | Another Main dish    | 20       |
